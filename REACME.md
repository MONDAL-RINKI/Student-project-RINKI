# Toggle Light Project

## Project Description

The Toggle Light Project is a simple web application designed to demonstrate basic interactivity using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core feature of this project is a button that allows users to toggle the visibility of a light image on the screen.

### Key Features:

1. **Light Toggle Functionality**: 
   - The project includes an image of a lamp and a corresponding light image that can be toggled on and off. 
   - When the user clicks the button labeled "On Light," the light image appears, and the button text changes to "Off Light."
   - Clicking the "Off Light" button hides the light image and changes the button text back to "On Light."

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring that the webpage looks good on different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The button provides an interactive element, allowing users to control the light image with a single click.
   - The webpage offers immediate visual feedback as the light image visibility toggles and the button text updates.

### Project Structure:
.
├── `index.html`         # Main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage
├── `style.css`          # CSS file for styling the webpage
└── `script.js`          # JavaScript file for toggling the light and button text


- **Navigation Bar**: The webpage features a simple navigation bar with menu items, providing a basic structure for potential expansion.
- **Lamp and Light Imagery**: The central visual elements of the project are images representing a lamp and its corresponding light. The light image starts as invisible and only appears when the user interacts with the button.
- **Button Control**: The button beneath the descriptive text is the main control element of the project, allowing users to toggle the light on and off.

### Purpose:

The Toggle Light Project is ideal for learning and demonstrating basic JavaScript functionality in a web development context. It showcases how simple DOM manipulation can create interactive user experiences. This project is well-suited for beginners who want to understand how to link JavaScript logic with HTML elements to control visual aspects of a webpage.

Overall, this project serves as a foundational example of how to create interactive elements on a webpage using standard web technologies.
